# jsm
Three.js jsm directory with importmap setting removed.
  
Please note that not enough testing has been done.  
I'm not always involved with Three.js so updates may be delayed.
  
It is assumed to be used in the following directory structure.  
* build
  * three.module.min.js
* examples
  * jsm
